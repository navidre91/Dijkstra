# Dijkstra's shortest path

The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge.
The code implements Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using 1 (the first vertex) as the source vertex.
